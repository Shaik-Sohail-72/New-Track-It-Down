#   TRACK IT DOWN
“Track It Down” is a web application built using the MERN stack, specifically designed to address the problem of lost items on the KMIT campus. Many individuals   
struggle to locate their lost belongings as they cannot remember where they misplaced 
them. Existing methods, such as relying on WhatsApp groups to share information about 
lost or found items, lack reliability in ensuring that the message reaches the correct 
person. Track It Down aims to provide a centralized platform for finding lost items and 
reporting found items. The application utilizes a MongoDB database and incorporates a 
verification process to authenticate the rightful receiver of a found item. 
 In educational institutions like KMIT, the constant occurrence of lost items 
causes significant inconvenience and financial burdens for students and teachers. The 
primary motivation behind this project is to simplify the process of locating lost items while 
ensuring that they are returned to their rightful owners.
